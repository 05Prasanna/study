        <h3>HOW TO STUDY EFFECTIVELY</h3><br>
    
        While there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach when it comes to studying effectively, there are methods you can use
        <br> to improve your recall and long-term memory.

        <br>Remember: everyone has different learning techniques. 
        <br>What works for other students may not work for you.

        <br>Just keep trying until you discover the best way to study.
        <br>If you are a VU student, we will help you achieve your full potential by developing your confidence, academic ability, and study skills. 
        <br>With our support, you will gain essential skills for university.

        Here are our top tips to help you study effectively.

        <h3>1. GET ORGANISED</h3>
        Taking the time to get organised will set you up well and help you achieve your learning goals.<br>

         study tips:<br>

        Invest in a diary, and use it to keep track of current assignment deadlines.<br>
        Bring all the material and devices you need to class, so you can participate.<br>
        <br>You may find it helpful to pack your bag the night before, so you’re ready to go first thing in the morning.

        <h3>2. DON’T SKIP CLASS!</h3>
        <br>Skipping class can be detrimental to your learning and achieving your study goals.
        <br> It leaves gaping holes in your notes – and in your subject knowledge.

        <br>VU’s Block Model® is designed to give you more time to devote to work, your social life and other commitments.

        <br>Rather than juggling four subjects at once, you’ll concentrate on one unit (subject) over a four-week ‘block’ period. 
        <br>You’ll attend three-hour workshop-style classes, three times a week. 
        <br>The rest of your time can be used to study, work, see friends – whatever is most important to you.

        <br>Remember to practise active listening by focusing on what your teachers are saying in class and taking notes as needed.

        <h3>3. TAKE NOTES</h3>
        <br>To keep your brain engaged during class, take notes, which you can refer to later, as you refine your study techniques.

        Notes can help store information in your long-term memory, right there in class.<br>
        These notes will be important for reviewing when you’re completing assessments and assignments.

        You might find it handy to condense your notes after class, so they’re clear and easy to read. <br>
        Underline or highlight key points. If anything doesn’t make sense, you can seek clarification from your teacher.<br>

        You can also create visual aids like flow charts and mind maps to help simplify information. <br>
        For some students, these visual aids help them remember complex information and study more effectively.

        If you do miss a class, ask a study buddy or classmate if you can refer to their notes. <br>
        This will ensure there are no holes in your own notetaking.

        <h3>4. TALK TO YOUR TEACHER & ASK QUESTIONS</h3>
         Your teacher is, in a way, a resource who is there to be used!<br>
         The VU Block Model allows you to focus on one subject at a time.<br>
         Learning in a work-shop style class, you get the opportunity to know your teacher.<br>
         You can take advantage of this interactive learning environment by asking questions during or after class, where you can get fast feedback.<br>
         Teachers can further clarify any topics you find confusing<br>
         You may even be able to get a little direction on assignments before submitting.<br>
         Your teacher will no doubt be impressed with your initiative and happy to help.<br>

        <h3>5. SPACE OUT YOUR STUDYING</h3>
        One of the most effective ways of studying is to space out your learning sessions.<br>
        If you break up your study load over several days, you’ll retain information far more readily than if you crammed in one long session.<br>
        This can help deeply ingrain information, allowing you to retain it for the long term.<br>
        You’ll find you achieve much better results for it.<br>

    <div>
        <h3>6. CREATE A STUDY PLAN – & STICK TO IT</h3>
        One top study tip is to create a schedule or plan.<br>
        This is incredibly helpful for time management and can help you reach your learning goals.<br>
        A study plan will:<br>
       *  motivate you to study, as you’ll have time dedicated to learning<br>
       * keep you organised around work, hobbies and other commitments, as you can plan ahead<br>
       * break your study load into manageable blocks<br>
       * give you time to complete your assignments, ensuring they’re not rushed or last-minute.<br>
