    <p>"The Letter" is a short story written by W. Somerset Maugham. It tells the story of a couple, Leslie and Doris, living in Malaya (now Malaysia). Leslie is a clerk in a rubber plantation, and Doris is his wife. The story begins with the couple hosting a dinner party for some friends. During the party, a deadly cobra enters the room, causing chaos. Leslie successfully kills the cobra, but in the process, he's bitten and severely injured.

        As Leslie's condition worsens, Doris becomes increasingly desperate to get medical help for him. She decides to write a letter to the district officer, requesting urgent medical assistance. However, she knows that sending such a letter would reveal the illegal activities of the party guests, including gambling and drinking, which could have serious consequences for everyone involved.
        
        Despite her reservations, Doris decides to send the letter, believing that saving her husband's life is the top priority. The story explores themes of morality, sacrifice, and the consequences of one's actions.</p></div><br>
